* Running

Run parameter.m to load all parameters of the robot and the controller. For
type 1 motion of control, change the type = 1, and type = 2 to select the
type 2 motion of control.

For problem 1, consider the tricycle.slx. 3 tests and the open-loop, closed
-loop controller are enclosed in there.

For problem 2, run kalman.m

* Add in
Problem 1, we use extended .m file to present the simulation results:
+ test_model.m  used to present the simulation of 3 tests
+ tracking.m    used to present the simulation of both open- & closed-loop
controller

Besides, all function files are use for modularization and support to solve
all Prolems.
